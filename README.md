# Baseunits for Scala

This is a class library including domain models to deal with time and money.

The original product of our baseunits is Time & Money Library, Open
Source library(MIT License) developed by Eric Evans with others.
It is a very meaningful example of Domain Driven-Design.
Even more remarkable, it contributes a lot to programming Time and
Money in Java.

Unfortunately, according to Domain Language, Inc., Time & Money
Library is no longer active.
